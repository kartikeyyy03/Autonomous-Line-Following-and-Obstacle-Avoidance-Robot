Designed and developed a robotic system capable of autonomous navigation using a three-sensor setup (left, center, right).
Utilized Arduino for microcontroller programming to implement line-following and obstacle-avoidance algorithms.
Focused on sensor calibration, real-time decision-making, and efficient hardware integration.
Enhanced navigation safety and accuracy in dynamic environments.
